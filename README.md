# Workload-Analysis

We analyze three different traces, Google, Alibaba and Azure to measure compatibility between various cloud systems. 

ARIMA and LSTM were employed to obtain forecasting values. RMSE and MAPE were used as evaluation metrics

We also implemented K-Means algorithm using shapelets and measured similarity between various traces to verify the obtained results
